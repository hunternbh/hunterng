**As Coarse As Emporium** is a Singaporean noir thriller novel about **ten-year-old Bee**, who grows up inside a Singapore shopping mall known as **The Emporium**.

Set against the hum of escalators, neon signage, and after-hours silence, the novel follows Bee as he navigates a childhood shaped not by playgrounds, but by shopfronts, service corridors, and adults who live double lives.

## The Premise
The Emporium is not just a mall—it is Bee’s home, shelter, and classroom. By day, it is a place of routine commerce. By night, it reveals a different logic: surveillance without care, intimacy without safety, and transactions that never appear on receipts.

As unsettling incidents ripple through the building—quiet disappearances, whispered warnings, and spaces that feel wrong after dark—Bee begins to understand the invisible rules governing adult life. In a world designed to sell comfort and desire, he learns how easily both can be weaponized.

## Setting
- **Location:** Singapore  
- **Primary Setting:** *The Emporium*, a commercial building that functions as a living system  
- **Tone:** Singaporean noir — air-conditioned, orderly, and quietly oppressive  
- **Themes:** childhood innocence, surveillance, class, displacement, power, and moral ambiguity  

## About Bee
Bee is ten years old—observant, underestimated, and small enough to pass unnoticed. He grows up learning how to read silences, body language, and locked doors. The mall teaches him what adults will not: where safety ends, where appearances lie, and how survival depends on attention.

## Featured Chapter: *The Sauna*

One of the novel’s central chapters, **“The Sauna,”** explores how spaces designed for care, cleansing, and comfort can become morally ambiguous once filtered through power, scarcity, and childhood vulnerability.

> A sauna used to be a straightforward construction in the past.  
> The oldest saunas were simple spaces heated to a high temperature by fireplaces.  
> People went in, sweated, detoxed and had a refreshing shower thereafter.  
> It was a sensual experience, but not sexual.  
>
> When I was ten years old, Helen, my adoptive mom earned a meagre income working for June, her mom, at her salon. Helen and I led a frugal life. In the daytime, nobody was home to care for me, so Helen brought me to the salon.  
>
> The salon was located in The Emporium, a commercial building in the heart of Singapore. When I was old enough, I took public transport to the salon after school. While she was busy with customers, our neighbours from other shops would take care of me. I became very good friends with most of them.

In this chapter, Bee reflects on **how adult spaces are explained to children in sanitized terms**, and how meaning changes once innocence collides with economic necessity and proximity to adult desire. The sauna becomes both a literal location and a metaphor—an enclosed, heated environment where boundaries blur and silence becomes complicit.
