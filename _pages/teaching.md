**My Approach towards Teaching**
- [Download Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5611810)
- Teaching used to be given only to the best minds in ancient civilizations. This is because there is no higher duty than transmitting society's progress to the next generation, so that human kind improves upon itself in each iteration. Today, that trend is the opposite, with top-caliber people going on to other professions. I claim that students today are influenced by 80% Internet, 15% parents, 5% grandparents and other factors. In such an environment, where does school come in? The enlightened teacher recognizes that colleges instruct students not professionally, but in how to be human. Youtube and AI will exceed teacher's role in giving information in every sense of the word, whether it is engaging students' attention or transmitting information. As such, the duty of the teacher today is two-fold. To teach about the way of life that will prepare childrens' minds for what society and living is about. And to organize and curate information based on his practical working experience. The two need to be in tandem, and the output of learning depends on both student and teacher. It is a virtuous circle.
