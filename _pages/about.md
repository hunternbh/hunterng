I am a 4th year PhD candidate in Accountancy at Baruch College, City University of New York.

I graduated with two 1st Class Honours Degrees in Accountancy and Business Analytics from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and a MBA from Baruch College. I have a Graduate Certificate in Technopreneurship and Innovation from Nanyang Technological University.

I previously worked in Fujitsu's cloud computing department, Tokyo Japan and Singapore's Central Bank's (MAS) fintech division on Project Ubin, distributed ledgers and a stablecoin used for market clearing with the central bank under [Toh Wee Kee](https://daweek.org/speaker/wee-kee-toh/). I also worked in KPMG Singapore's Digital Trust Department on projects involving IT security audits. 

In 2021, I set up my own floral boutique school in Singapore. I have also incorporated my own sole-proprietor publish a noir-thriller novel that is listed for borrowing in public libraries in Singapore.

I have sat on the executive committee board of a SGD$800 million private shopping mall in Singapore together with [Lawrence Leow](https://www.sgengrs.com/our-team/lawrence-leow/) from Crescendas Group.

I have received teachings from NoPaul Krugman and many other top scholars during my PhD journey.

<!-- I identify as a programmer, accountant, researcher and a business man. My dream is to commercialize my research or set up my own hedge-crypto fund, then create an endowment that will fund scholarships for children. It is our duty as humanity to make the next generation better than us. We must nurture conscious, empowered human beings. -->
